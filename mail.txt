Hi {candidate name},
I hope you are well!

The repo has been created, did you receive the notification?

The test usually takes between 3-5h, but if you need more time don't hesitate to take it and explain why. You don't have to do it all at once if you don't feel like it. Don't forget to put your focus on quality, good practices, and UI ;)

We expect the test to be returned by Monday at the latest. Could you please let Constance know your availability over the course of next week, so that she can plan out the last steps of the process please?

If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out directly to Constance or me.
I wish you good luck and all the best for the rest of the process 
Cheers,
